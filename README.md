# 100-days-cuda
- Day 1: Vector Addition, PPMP Chapter 1 Overview
- Day 2: Matrix Addition, PPMP Chapter 1 Deeper Read (on a smaller portion - due to lack of time)
- Day 3: Multiplication of a vector and a matrix - this felt easy based on learnings from yesterday. I learnt some nuances on "when not to parallelize" (i.e: when allocation overhead becomes more complex than the computation itself.
- Day 4: Read Chapter 2 of PPMP, Working on Prefix Sum Parellization.
